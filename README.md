In 2020, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, in response to several complaints of excessive use of force and executions by the security forces in Rio de Janeiro, demanded the creation of a State Plan for the Reduction of Lethality. As part of the plan, the Supreme Court also required the introduction of operational portable body cameras on police uniforms to measure external control over police activities. However, the State Government, which is in charge of the police, strongly resisted implementing this measure. The cameras were only deployed in mid-2022. Even then, not all police detachments are utilizing the technology. In order to comprehend the impacts of body cameras on the use of force, a difference-in-differences model was employed. The crime statistics are from the Institute of Public Security (http://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br/estatistica.html). Information regarding the introduction of cameras in the police battalions and their respective dates were obtained from pieces of ADPF nยบ 635 (https://portal.stf.jus.br/processos/detalhe.asp?incidente=5816502).
