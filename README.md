## Introduction

In 2020, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, in response to several complaints of excessive use of force and executions by the security forces in Rio de Janeiro, demanded the creation of a State Plan for the Reduction of Lethality. As part of the plan, the Supreme Court also required the introduction of operational portable body cameras on police uniforms to measure external control over police activities. However, the State Government, which is in charge of the police, strongly resisted implementing this measure. The cameras were only deployed in mid-2022. Even then, not all police detachments are utilizing the technology. To comprehend the impacts of body cameras on the use of force, a difference-in-differences model was employed. The crime statistics are from the Institute of Public Security (http://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br/estatistica.html). Information regarding the introduction of cameras in the police battalions and their respective dates were obtained from documents of ADPF nÂº 635 (https://portal.stf.jus.br/processos/detalhe.asp?incidente=5816502).

## How BWCs were introduced in Rio de Janeiro Police Force?

The state of Rio de Janeiro has been divided into several integrated zones to improve the organization, planning, and coordination of efforts related to public security. This division is structured into three levels: (i) RISP - Integrated Public Security Regions, (ii) CISP - Integrated Public Security Circuits, and (iii) AISP - Integrated Public Security Areas. This study will specifically concentrate on the Integrated Public Security Areas (AISP) level, which designates specific territories for each battalion within the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro (PMERJ).

The following image illustrates the timeline at which each territorial unit (battalion) received the cameras.

## Empirical Strategy

Formmally, the main econometric goal is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT) for each group g treated at different moments in time t and then aggregate them using a weighting vector:

$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
